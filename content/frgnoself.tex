The results shown in this section are obtained in standard fRG using an interaction cutoff: $G_0^\Lambda = \Lambda G_0$. The calculations are performed on the Matsubara frequency axis for temperature $T=0,08 t$, where $t$ is the nearest neighbors hopping.  
The momentum dependence of the vertex is treated by means of a form factor decomposition, while keeping 29 patches in the respective bosonic momentum transfer . The critical scale is fixed by the condition that the absolute value of one of the channels exceeds a value of 1200$t$ (similar results when analyzing the suscpetibility).
