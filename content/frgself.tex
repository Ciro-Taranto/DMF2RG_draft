\begin{itemize}

\item The self-energy flow is unreliable. It suffers from the finite frequency box of the vertex. 

\item Self energy inclusion suppresses the charge channel in favor of FM fluctuations, see Fig. \ref{selfsuppressfrg}. 

\item Self energy lowers the critical scale.

\item For the set of parameters considered ($U=4t$, $T=0.08t$, $t'=-0.10$, van Hove filling) the self energy seemed to be Fermi liquid like and did not show any sign of divergent behavior. 

\item In figure \ref{fermisurface} one can see that the self energy affects the Fermi surface which gets broadened, as we deduce from the momentum dependent occupation shown. 

\end{itemize}
