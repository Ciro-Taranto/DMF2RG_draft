Plots of the static

Color plot of the vertex: only show Mag where it is diverging and where not for Omega=0 and Charge ==> Show that the frequency structure is localized in the charge;
 
The same but for DMF2RG;

PLOT : only magnetic and charge with and without self energy
Self Energy DMFT vs DMF2RG: show that it seems to be a minore correction ; 

Perpendicular ladders: Possibly also include some formulas, but mainly the color plot; 
Perpendicular ladders Chi of nu. 

DMF2RG function of Lambda for the same scale
